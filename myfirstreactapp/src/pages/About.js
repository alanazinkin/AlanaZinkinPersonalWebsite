        <h5>Hi, I'm Alana!</h5>
        <p className='aboutmep1'>I started learning computer science
        right before my freshman year through the Codecademy “Learn Java”
        course. I fell in love with the experience of using code to solve problems.</p>
        <p className='aboutmep2'>I enrolled in Duke's CS201: Data Structures and Algorithms, and have 
        continued exploring other CS courses ever since. Now, I am learning about databases, designing complex algorithms, and javascript through Duke courses and my own 
        personal projects, such as this website.</p>
        <p className='aboutmep3'>After participating in Duke's Silicon Valley Program, I discovered my love of innovation and entrepreneurship. 
        I enjoyed learning about product development, user experience, and design principles. This summer I am living in Washington, D.C. where I am interning as a Solutions Engineer at Deloitte. This opportunity 
        has allowed me to witness and implement these concepts to meet client needs.</p>
        <p className='aboutmep4'>I will always call Long Island, New York my home, but am excited to explore new cities and places. Outside of my professional career, I enjoy working as a tennis instructor, traveling (I most recently visited Iceland),
        eating lots of ice cream (especially Van Leeuwen), relaxing with family and friends at Long Island beaches, or walking outside while listening to a podcast!
