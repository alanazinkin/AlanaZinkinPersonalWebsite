        <h5>Hi, I'm Alana!</h5>
        <p className='aboutmep1'>I started learning computer science
        right before my freshman year through the Codecademy “Learn Java”
        course. I fell in love with the experience of building using code and creativity.</p>
        <p className='aboutmep2'>I always thought I would enter the medical field and eventually
        become a doctor, but soon realized that I could reach a larger patient
        population through improvements in medical technology. </p>
        <p className='aboutmep3'>I enrolled in CS201: Data Structures and Algorithms, and have 
        continued exploring other CS courses ever since. Now, I am continuing
        to learn about computer science through Duke courses and my own 
        personal projects, such as this website!</p>
        <p className='aboutmep4'>I was raised on Long Island, New York, and
         only recently moved to North Carolina to attend Duke. When I’m not typing away at a computer or prototyping
          in Figma, you can find me working as a tennis instructor, teaching 
          both children and adults, traveling (I most recently visited Iceland!),
          eating ice cream, learning how to cook a new vegetarian recipe, 
          relaxing with family and friends, or spending time outside somewhere sunny!
