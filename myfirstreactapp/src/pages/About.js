        <h5>Hi, I'm Alana!</h5>
        <p className='aboutmep1'>I started learning computer science
        right before my freshman year through the Codecademy “Learn Java”
        course. I fell in love with the experience of using code to solve problems.</p>
        <p className='aboutmep2'>I always beleived that I would enter the medical field and eventually
        become a doctor, but soon realized that I could reach a larger patient
        population through improvements in medical technology. </p>
        <p className='aboutmep3'>I enrolled in Duke's CS201: Data Structures and Algorithms, and have 
        continued exploring other CS courses ever since. Now, I am learning about databases, discrete math, and javascript through Duke courses and my own 
        personal projects, such as this website!</p>
        <p className='aboutmep4'>I was raised on Long Island, New York, and
         only recently moved to North Carolina to attend Duke. When I’m not typing away at a computer, I am either working as a tennis instructor, traveling (I most recently visited Iceland ad Greece),
          eating ice cream, learning how to cook a new vegetarian recipe, 
          relaxing with family and friends at the beach, or taking a walk while listening to a podcast!
